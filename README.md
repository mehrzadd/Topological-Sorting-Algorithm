# Topological-Sorting-Algorithm
# Implementing the topological sorting algorithm in Python

Input: from the command line the name of the edge list of a directed graph.
Recall that, in the edge list file of a directed graph, an edge is represented by two vertex indices, x and y, meaning there is an edge from vertex x to vertex y.

â€¢ Output: to the standard output

If the graph is acyclic, an ordered list of vertex indices such that x proceeds y if there is an edge from vertex x to vertex y.
Otherwise, the fact it cannot be topologically sorted.
